Idea: If flow is sent through the head of a crab the flow will be max. Let's transform the problem to a maximum flow problem.

        N - number of verices. Since we are only interested in crabs we can modify the graph,
        so that from each vertex you can go through the adjacent edges only: from-vertex is map to an even number,
        while to-vertex is mapped to an odd number. This splits the graph in crabs.
        This also allows us to create a flow network graph.

        We need a source node and a sink node. Flow from the source node will go to any even node of the graph.
